###### TO DO ######

Confidence intervals: make a function for calculating them from complex lm and rlm objects. Like the confint function from the stats package.

generalized linear model

weighted median for complex data

huber estimator for complex data

s-estimator for complex data

DONE. incorporate the directional nature of the derivatives of the influence functions, mainly relavent for redescending estimators (Hampel and bisquare).
