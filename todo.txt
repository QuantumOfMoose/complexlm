###### TO DO ######

Confidence intervals: make a function for calculating them from complex lm and rlm objects. Like the confint function from the stats package.

It seems that there is a problem with ANOVA?

DONE Apparently the output of summary.complex() is unclear. Try to fix it.

Modify print methods to explicitly state that the data is complex.

SKIP generalized linear model

SKIP weighted median for complex data

SKIP huber estimator for complex data

SKIP s-estimator for complex data

DONE. incorporate the directional nature of the derivatives of the influence functions, mainly relavent for redescending estimators (Hampel and bisquare).

SKIP come up with better names for the "pseudo-" variances, covariances, and standard errors. Maybe "complex-" ? Or "relation-" ?

DONE Remove uneeded code from MASS.c, rename.

SKIP pseudo MAD?

DONE? add missing functions for complex linear model.

modify model.c from stats to allow complex variables in model matrices.
  Built work around in R. Call it DONE for now.

DONE documentation

DONE add citations to documentation

DONE add examples to documentation.

DONE make a complex version of Mahalanobis distance function.

DONE add complex compatible cov, cor, and cov2cor functions.

DONE clean up example file.

Repair package so that it passes new CRAN tests.
