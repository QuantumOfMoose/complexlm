###### TO DO ######

Confidence intervals: make a function for calculating them from complex lm and rlm objects. Like the confint function from the stats package.

generalized linear model

weighted median for complex data

huber estimator for complex data

s-estimator for complex data

DONE. incorporate the directional nature of the derivatives of the influence functions, mainly relavent for redescending estimators (Hampel and bisquare).

come up with better names for the "pseudo-" variances, covariances, and standard errors. Maybe "complex-" ? Or "relation-" ?

Done Remove uneeded code from MASS.c, rename.

pseudo MAD?

DONE? add missing functions for complex linear model.

modify model.c from stats to allow complex variables in model matrices.
  Built work around in R. Call it DONE for now.

DONE documentation

add citations to documentation

DONE add examples to documentation.

DONE make a complex version of Mahalanobis distance function.

add complex compatible cov, cor, and cov2cor functions.

clean up example file.
