\title{complexlm: Linear Fitting for Complex Valued Data}
\description{
Tools for linear fitting with complex variables. Includes ordinary least-squares (zlm()) and robust M-estimation (rzlm()), and complex methods for oft used generics. Originally adapted from the rlm() functions of 'MASS' and the lm() functions of 'stats'.
